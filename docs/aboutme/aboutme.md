<!-- 
I was bourn in shiraz, a beautiful city in Iran. I was always fastened by technology and advanced thing. I remember when I was five or six I turned a simple car toy to work with a controller.
I went to one of the best high schools in my city, Emam Reza School, and graduated with a a good GPA.

Then i went to collage ,Shiraz University, for my BSc degree. Which is one the prestiges universities in my country. I learned mechanical Engineering. In the collage I met the best teachers i ever had Prof Mohammad Eghtesad(May his soul rest in peace). He shown me the ways I'll ever wanted to know -->

I have always been fascinated by how different devices around me work, what is the theory, and the knowledge behind them. This led to learning about robots in high school and attending robotics classes. After learning some basics of robotics in those classes, I had to choose whether to go for higher education or not, so I decided to participate in the nationwide exam for university entrance in Iran, and I got accepted into the Shiraz University in the field of mechanical engineering, which is one of best universities in my country and also one of the hardest too.In this exam, I ranked in the top 2% among 150k participants in the felid of mathematics and physics.

I started my undergraduate studies in the felid of mechanical engineering. In university, I met very motivated professors, one of whom was Professor Mohammad Eghtesad. He was both a great supervisor and a great mentor for me. He was an expert in control theory with many published papers. He showed me what I was looking for, the reason I went to university. So, his advice led me to learn about classical control, learning about electrical circuits and how the microcontroller works and how I can combine my previous knowledge in mechanical engineering with this newly discovered knowledge to build robots and other mechatronics devices. Around this time, I also started to learn programming, which is one of my passions. I learned C, C++, and Python by myself, and I have a great understanding of them. In the mechatronics coursethat Professor Eghtesad instructed as the course project, I designed and built a color detection sensor with just a microcontroller, a photo-resistor, and some LEDs. For the final project of the bachelor’s degree, I created and built an IOT-enabled garden with Professor Eghtesad’s Supervision and got a complete mark of 20 in Iran. In the middle of my studies, some personal problems arose that made me lose focus in 2nd and 3rd year, and therefore, my GPA fell in this period, but I managed to pull myself out of those problems and finished the program with an average of 14.68/20 which was more than the average in the department. I also have been in the Shiraz University Robotics Association, a volunteer job that wants to help students learn robotics better. In this association, I have taught ARDUINO and Matlab to the students. I have been honored to be a TA for the statics course two times at this university.

After finishing my B.S. degree, I started to work in a knowledge-based company. I was titled a mechatronics engineer as I have knowledge in mechanics, electronics, and programming. In this position, I had the opportunity to work with talented engineers and learn how to build a complete product. This also helped me to work with a bigger team compared to university. At that time, we made a hospital bed with dome modification to make a patient’s life easy. In this project, my responsibility was to write the code for UI and all the low-level control. Fullstack software developer. Apart from that, I’ve also done some of the electronic parts of this project. During this time, I was curious about artificial intelligence, so I worked with the AI team at the company to learn about this new topic. After learning some basics from the team, I was involved in some of the company’s AI projects. I also learned how to use ROS in my robotics project. Working taught me many valuable lessons, like teamwork, and I had the opportunity to use my knowledge to improve the world. The CEO of the company is Professor Sajjad Taghvaei who was one of my instructors at Shiraz University.

I was enjoying working, but something was   missing. Using my knowledge as an engineer wasgreat, but I felt the need for a more theoretical side of engineering and research. So I quit my job, which was hard for me, and I participated in another nationwide university entrance exam, this time for a master’s degree. I was in the top 0.5% of participants and was accepted into Shahid Beheshti University in the felid of mechatronics engineering. Here, I met some brilliant people who showed me the way of research, and now I am in the process of writing two research papers, one for the control of quad-rotors and the other for path tracking of self-driving car. This time, I got a GPA of 17.50/20. I have the highest GPA in my department as of right now. All thanks to my previous knowledge. As my thesis, I started to work on path tracking for self-driving cars and learned some of the advanced control algorithms like reinforcement learning, MPC, and SMC, which mostly deal with nonlinear systems. I also have the opportunity to be a TA for courses like artificial intelligence and advanced and classical control and teach other students my knowledge in these fields. I like learning new things and I am not afraid of that. -->

## Introduction

I'm a mechatronics engineer with a strong passion for robotics and control systems. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in mechatronics engineering at Shahid Beheshti University, where I'm actively involved in research on control systems for quad-rotors and self-driving cars.
My fascination with how things work around me led me to explore robotics in high school and eventually pursue mechanical engineering at Shiraz University. There, I met Professor Mohammad Eghtesad, whose guidance significantly impacted my academic journey. He introduced me to classical control theory, electronics, and microcontrollers, inspiring me to combine these fields with my mechanical engineering background to build robots and mechatronic devices.

## Educational Background

While my undergraduate studies were met with some challenges, I persevered and graduated with an average GPA exceeding the departmental average. During this time, I actively volunteered at the Shiraz University Robotics Association, teaching students ARDUINO and Matlab, and even served as a teaching assistant for the statics course.
After graduation, I began working as a mechatronics engineer at a knowledge-based company. This experience allowed me to collaborate with talented engineers, learn the intricacies of building complete products, and work effectively within a larger team. Notably, I contributed to a hospital bed project, handling both the UI code and low-level control aspects. This role also sparked my curiosity about artificial intelligence, leading me to collaborate with the company's AI team and gain valuable exposure to the field.

## Professional Experience

While I enjoyed the practical application of my engineering skills, I yearned for a deeper understanding of the theoretical and research aspects of the field. This desire led me to pursue a Master's degree, where I excelled in the entrance exam and secured a position at Shahid Beheshti University. Here, I'm surrounded by brilliant minds and actively engaged in research, currently authoring papers on quad-rotor control and self-driving car path tracking. My research journey has also equipped me with advanced control algorithms like reinforcement learning, Model Predictive Control (MPC), and Sliding Mode Control (SMC).

## Outro

Moreover, I continue to share my knowledge by serving as a teaching assistant for courses like artificial intelligence, advanced control, and classical control. My passion for learning and overcoming challenges fuels my pursuit of excellence in mechatronics engineering and research.
