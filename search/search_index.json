Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in mechatronics engineering at Shahid Beheshti University, where I'm actively involved in research on control systems for quad-rotors and self-driving cars. My fascination with how things work around me led me to explore robotics in high school and eventually pursue mechanical engineering at Shiraz University. There, I met Professor Mohammad Eghtesad, whose guidance significantly impacted my academic journey. He introduced me to classical control theory, electronics, and microcontrollers, inspiring me to combine these fields with my mechanical engineering background to build robots and mechatronic devices.</p>"},{"location":"aboutme/aboutme/#educational-background","title":"Educational Background","text":"<p>While my undergraduate studies were met with some challenges, I persevered and graduated with an average GPA exceeding the departmental average. During this time, I actively volunteered at the Shiraz University Robotics Association, teaching students ARDUINO and Matlab, and even served as a teaching assistant for the statics course. After graduation, I began working as a mechatronics engineer at a knowledge-based company. This experience allowed me to collaborate with talented engineers, learn the intricacies of building complete products, and work effectively within a larger team. Notably, I contributed to a hospital bed project, handling both the UI code and low-level control aspects. This role also sparked my curiosity about artificial intelligence, leading me to collaborate with the company's AI team and gain valuable exposure to the field.</p>"},{"location":"aboutme/aboutme/#professional-experience","title":"Professional Experience","text":"<p>While I enjoyed the practical application of my engineering skills, I yearned for a deeper understanding of the theoretical and research aspects of the field. This desire led me to pursue a Master's degree, where I excelled in the entrance exam and secured a position at Shahid Beheshti University. Here, I'm surrounded by brilliant minds and actively engaged in research, currently authoring papers on quad-rotor control and self-driving car path tracking. My research journey has also equipped me with advanced control algorithms like reinforcement learning, Model Predictive Control (MPC), and Sliding Mode Control (SMC).</p>"},{"location":"aboutme/aboutme/#outro","title":"Outro","text":"<p>Moreover, I continue to share my knowledge by serving as a teaching assistant for courses like artificial intelligence, advanced control, and classical control.
